One Calculator to Calculate Them All!
This project provides a comprehensive calculator for various measurements and costs associated with rings(Reference to Lord of the Rings). It calculates the volume of a ring both with and without an inner cutout, the material and forging costs for multiple rings, and the specific costs for creating "The One Ring."

Features
Volume Calculation:

Calculates the volume of a ring without an inner cutout.
Calculates the volume of the inner cutout based on a ratio.
Calculates the net volume of a ring with the inner cutout.
Cost Calculation for Multiple Rings:

Calculates the total material needed for a specified number of rings.
Calculates the total cost of material and forging for the rings.
Cost Calculation for "The One Ring":

Calculates the cost of material for "The One Ring."
Usage
