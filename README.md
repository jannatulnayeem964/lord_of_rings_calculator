One Calculator to Calculate Them All!
This project provides a comprehensive calculator for various measurements and costs associated with rings(Reference to Lord of the Rings). It calculates the volume of a ring both with and without an inner cutout, the material and forging costs for multiple rings, and the specific costs for creating "The One Ring."

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Volume Calculation:</h3>

<p>Calculates the volume of a ring without an inner cutout.</p>
<p>Calculates the volume of the inner cutout based on a ratio.</p>
<p>Calculates the net volume of a ring with the inner cutout.</p>

<h3>Cost Calculation for Multiple Rings:</h3>

<p>Calculates the total material needed for a specified number of rings.</p>
<p>Calculates the total cost of material and forging for the rings.</p>

<h3>Cost Calculation for "The One Ring":</h3>

<p>Calculates the cost of material for "The One Ring."</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Example Inputs and Outputs</h3>
<p>Volume of a Ring</p>
<p>Diameter of a ring (in cm)? 20</p>
<p>Height of a ring (in mm)? 10</p>
<p>Volume of a ring without the inner cutout is: 314000.0 mm^3</p>
<p>Ratio of the inner cutout diameter (as a decimal)? 0.90</p>
<p>Volume of the inner cutout is: 2543400000.0 mm^3</p>
<p>Volume of a ring with the inner cutout is: 59660.0 mm^3</p>
<p>Rings of Power</p>
<p>Number of rings? 3</p>
<p>Cost of the material (in cents per cubic inch)? 10</p>
<p>Forging cost (in cents per ring)? 12</p>
<p>Total material needed is: -7629258000.0 mm^3</p>
<p>Total number of cubes to purchase is: -465565 cube(s)</p>
<p>Cost for the Rings of Power is: 1 dollar(s) and 46 cent(s)!</p>
<p>The One Ring</p>
<p>Cost of the material (in cents per cubic inch)? 100</p>
<p>Number of cubes to purchase is: 4 cube(s)</p>
<p>Cost for the One Ring is: 4 dollar(s) and 36 cent(s)!</p>
